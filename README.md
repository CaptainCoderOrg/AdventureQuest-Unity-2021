# Adventure Quest 2021

Adventure Quest is a point and click adventure inspired by traditional table top
role playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, Swords & Sorcery, and Fate Core.

Throughout this project, you will learn about:

* Object Oriented Design Principles in C#
* Unit Testing with Unity Test Framework
* Unity's User Interface Framework
* Using UnityEvents to manage program complexity

## Part 0 - Setup

[LINK](00%20-%20Setup/README.md)

In this section, you will download the project template and import it into Unity Hub.

# Chapter 1: Modeling a Die

## Part 1 - Modeling a Die

[LINK](01%20-%20Modeling%20a%20Die/README.md)

In this section, you will create a `Die` class which models a multi-sided die
that can be rolled. Additionally, you will be introduced to Unity's Test Framework.

## Part 2 - Creating a Die Roller Scene

[LINK](02-DieRoller/README.md)

In this section, you will create a `Scene` with a `Button` that can roll a `Die`
and display the result in the Unity console.

## Part 3 - Adding an OnRoll Event

[LINK](03-OnRollEvent/README.md)

In this section, you will learn how to add `UnityEvent`s to your scripts and
update elements on the screen when a `Die` is rolled.

## Part 4: Creating a Die Button Prefab

[LINK](04-DieButtonPrefab/README.md)

In this section, you will learn about Unity `Prefab` `GameObject`s to create a
generalized `Die Button` that can be easily added to any `Scene`.
