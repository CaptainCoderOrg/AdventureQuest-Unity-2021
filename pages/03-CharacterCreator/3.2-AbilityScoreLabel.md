# 3.1: Ability Score Label

In most table top RPGs, the characters have different attributes that track how
good (or bad) that character is at performing different actions. In Adventure
Quest, these will be called **Abilities** and each **Ability** will have an
**Ability Score** associated with it. In this chapter, you will create an
`AbilityScore` **class** to model these attributes.

# Good Time to Commit

TODO

If you have not already done so, now would be a good time to make a commit. You just
finished a feature. More specifically, you implemented an `AbilityScore` **class**.

{% include GitHub/CreateCommit.md %}

# What's Next

TODO

With an `AbilityScore` **class** in place you can start work on a **Character Creation** `Scene`. 
In [3.2 Ability Score Label], you will make a new `Prefab` defining how an `AbilityScore` will
be displayed in the **Character Creation** `Scene`.
