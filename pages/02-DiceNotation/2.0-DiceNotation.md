# Chapter 2: Dice Notation

In this part of the project you will implement a `DiceGroup` class that allows you to specify groups of like-sided dice to be rolled together. For example, in Dungeon and Dragons, a character's ability scores are generated using 3 six-sided dice (`3d6`).

Additionally, in Part 2 you will create a `Dice Roller` `Scene` that will allow the user to specify a `DiceGroup` using [Dice Notation] and roll it.
For example, in the project below, you can enter `3d6` and roll the dice to see the possible outcomes. You could also enter `20d100`! Give it a try!

# [2.1: Dice Group]

In this chapter, you will write a `DiceGroup` class which represents a group of
like sided dice that can be rolled together.

# [2.2: Dice Group Roller]

In this chapter, you will use everything you've learned thus far (and more) to
implement a `Dice Group Roller` that allows the user to specify a `DiceGroup`
and roll it.
