# Chapter 7: Histogram
{: .no_toc }

In [Chapter 5: Dice Group], you created a `DiceGroup` which simulates rolling
groups of like sided dice (e.g. `3d6` or `2d4` or `1d20`). Then, in [Chapter 6:
Dice Group Roller] you created a `Scene` that allows the user to use [Dice
Notation] to specify and roll an arbitrary `DiceGroup`.

In this chapter, you will create a `Histogram` **class** which models a
[Histogram] of the outcomes that occur when a `Die` or `DiceGroup` is rolled
multiple times.
