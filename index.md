# Captain Coder's Adventure Quest

Welcome to Captain Coder's Adventure Quest! This site will help guide you
through learning how to create a Point and Click adventure game in Unity that is
inspired by classic Table Top Role Playing Games such as Dungeons & Dragons,
Swords & Sorcery, and Fate Core!

## Learning Goals

This project is focused heavily on teaching you how to manage the complexity of
large(ish) programs written with C# and Unity. More specifically, this project
focuses on:

* Object Oriented Design Principles in C#
* Unit Testing with Unity Test Framework
* Unity's User Interface Framework
* Using UnityEvents to manage program complexity

## Who is this project for?

This project was designed to be used by anyone who has the basics of programming
in C# under there belt. Before starting, you should be relatively comfortable
with:

* Variables
* Boolean Logic
* If Statements
* Loops
* Methods

### Note about Object Oriented Programming

Although it isn't necessary to be familiar with classes and object oriented
programming, it isn't an absolute requirement. Throughout this project you will
be exposed to Object Oriented (OO) design principles and asked to use good
practices. My hope is that, if you're not familiar designing your own classes
and objects, you will learn about them by practicing them.

## What if I'm not ready?

Unity is a very powerful framework for creating cross platform applications and
games. In my opinion, attempting to learn to program **WHILE** learning how to
use Unity is incredibly challenging and often results in learning bad habits. I
**highly** recommend learning the basics listed above before attempting to use
Unity.

If you're new to programming, [Captain Coder's Adventures in C#] is an
interactive online workbook that provides lessons, activities, and projects that
will help you learn the basics.

If you prefer a physical text book, I highly recommend [The C# Player's Guide].
It is my personal favorite C# book for absolute beginners.

Another good option is [The Yellow Book]. This book has the advantage of having
a *FREE* digital copy.
